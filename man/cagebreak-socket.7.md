cagebreak-socket(7) "Version 2.4.0" "Cagebreak Manual"

# NAME

*cagebreak-socket* Cagebreak socket

# SYNOPSIS

*ipc-socket-capable-tool \$CAGEBREAK_SOCKET*

# DESCRIPTION

The cagebreak socket is an ipc socket.

The socket is enabled if cagebreak is invoked with the `-e` flag.

The socket accepts cagebreak commands as input (see *cagebreak-config(5)* for more information).

Events are provided as output as specified in this man page.

## EVENTS

Events have a general structure as follows:

```
"cg-ipc"json object depending on the eventNULL
```

Here is an example of how this works using *only* as a command sent over the socket.

```
only
cg-ipc{"event_name":"fullscreen",
"tile_id":2,
"workspace":1,
"output":"eDP-1"}
```

This documentation describes the trigger for the events, the keys and the data
type of the values of each event.

## SECURITY

The socket has to be explicitly enabled using the `-e` flag.

The socket is restricted to the user for reading, writing and execution (700).

All user software can execute arbitrary code while the cagebreak socket is running.
